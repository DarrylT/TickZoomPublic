Documentation for TickZoom

The user manual for TickZoom currently only covers Installation and How To Update from GitHub.
It is generated by Doxygen from the files in the Docs folder in case you wish to modify it.
This documentation will expand eventually to be full user manual plus a reference for the
entire TickZoom platform. The user manual is version controlled with the source code.

Here's the link to the user manual for the current version:

NOTE: The TickZoom open source application auto downloads the TickZoom data engine for which
a secure user key is required. You may request a 2 week FREE demo at http://www.tickzoom.com
