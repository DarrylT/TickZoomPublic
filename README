Setting Up Git With GitHub

If this is your first time to use Git or GitHub, follow these steps. 

1. Install Git http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic/Git-1.6.5.1-preview20091022.exe

2. Install TortoiseGit http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic/TortoiseGit-1.2.1.0-32bit.msi

3. Click "Signup" on the upper right corner of the GitHub site. It's free to create an account.

4. Next you need to setup a secure public key with your GitHub account to avoid entering a
   password every time you access Git or TortoiseGit. Follow these steps:
   
   a. Open a Git Bash prompt by right clicking on any folder in Windows Explorer and click "Git Bash Here".
   
   b. At the prompt enter the following command after replacing with your own email address:
   
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.address"
        (Please enter 3 times for default file name, and empty pass phrase.)
        
   c. Now, use Windows Explorer to find your C:\Documents and Setting\[User Name]\.ssh folder.
      Inside that folder you can select and open the id_rsa.pub file in Notepad.
   
   d. Copy everything in the id_rsa.pub file to the copy/paste clipboard.
   
   e. Now in a browser, open your GitHub account page. In the SSH Public Keys section click
      "add another public key", then paste your key into the key field. If you leave the title
      blank the key comment (your email) will be used for the title.

You have completed setup and install of Git with GitHub. Now proceed with setup of TickZooom.

Setting Up Your Copy of the Source for TickZoom

1. You need to "Fork" the TickZoomPublic project on GitHub by clicking the "fork" button on the github site for
   TickZoomPublic. This gives you a personal copy of the project to which you can push changes. Then a developer 
   can "pull" your changes back into the original TickZOOM project.
   
2. After forking you will be on the home page of your "fork" of the TickZoomPublic project. You will find
   2 url links on that page to "clone" your project. Copy the "Your Clone URL" which you can do easily by
   clicking the small arrow to the right of it.

3. Select or create a folder in Windows Explorer where you want to keep your TickZoomPublic source project.
   Right-click on that folder in Windows Explorer and select "Git Bash Here" to open a Git Bash prompt.
   
4. At the prompt enter: git clone [paste Your Clone URL]
   To paste your URL you need to click on upper left corner of the prompt window and select Edit then Paste.
   
5. You will see the progress as it creates the TickZoomPublic folder. It only takes several seconds.

Setting Up To Run TickZoom and Write Your Own Strategies

1. You need an IDE if you don't have one. Either SharpDevelop or Visual Studio will work.
   You can find installation tips for those further below, after this section.

2. Once you complete installation of SharpDevelop or Visual Studio, then you can navigate to the TickZoomPublic
   folder in Windows Explorer, then find the Platform/TickZoom.sln file and open it in either SharpDevelop or Visual
   Studio. 
   
3. Right click on the GUI project and select "Set as StartUp Project" in SharpDevelop or similar in Visual Studio.

4. Run the application using the big green arrow at the stop of SharpDevelop or similar in Visual Studio.
   
5. If you already have a TickZoom folder with subfolders of DataCache, AutoUpdate, etc, TickZoom will "self
   configure" by finding it on any disk drive and attach to it and run.
   
6. If the app never finds a TickZoom folder, then it will select your disk drive with the largest amount of free
   space and create the folder on that drive.
   
7. Next download the Sample data and extract it into your TickZoom folder. If you don't know where it is, you 
   can find it at the top of your largest disk drive. For example: C:\TickZoom or E:\TickZoom

Setting Up SharpDevelop for TickZoom

1. Install both SharpDevelop 3.1

   http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic/SharpDevelop_3.1.0.4977_Setup.msi

2. Get Windows 7 SDK which works for Vista and XP also. You can download the Windows 7 SDK from:

   Web Install: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=c17ba869-9671-4330-a63e-1fd44e0e2505
   
Setting Up Visual Studio

1. You will need a version of Visual Studio which supports .NET 3.5. The install typically includes the Windows SDK.

2. In Visual Studio, you must disable the feature that pops up dialog boxs for unhandled exceptions because of a defect
   in Visual Studio where it intercepts ordinary exceptions passed between DLLs. Otherwise, you will continually get
   these dialog boxes popping up when using Visual Studio.
