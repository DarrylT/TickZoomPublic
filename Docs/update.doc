/*! @page update How to Update From GitHub

@addindex update

You can use these steps to update your local TickZoomPublic clone to another, usually, the latest
version of TickZoom.

@note Before you update, you need to make certain that you already followed all the steps
to setup your clone. Specifically, make sure you setup auto rebase remote and configured
your user name and email. You will find the latest instructions at @ref setup_clone_sect

To update you need to open a Git Bash prompt on the folder that holds you local clone of the TickZoomPublic project
and then enter these commands:

@verbatim 
git stash
git pull upstream integrate
git push
git stash apply
@endverbatim

Here's the explanation of each of these commands:

-# git stash - "Stashes" any of your uncommitted changes which means that it extracts them
from the code and stores them in a separate buffer so you can re-apply them later.
-# git pull upstream - Pulls the latest version of code from the upstream repository. "integrate" may
be replaced by another available branch such as "stable" or "master".
-# git push - Pushes the update into your fork project on GitHub so that it
remains current. it also pushes up any code which you have committed to make it available for others
to includes in their projects and for committers to include in the official TickZoomPublic.
-# git stash apply This recalls your changes that you previously stashed and merges them into the updated
code. At this point you may find "conflicts" which are easiest to resolve using the TortoiseGit features
called "Check for Modifications" and double click on the file that has conflicts to fix it using a 
graphical side-by-side diff.
